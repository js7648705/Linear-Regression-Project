## Linear Regression Project
* Performed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis on the initial data set	

* Investigated relation between mpg and transmissions types for cars.
   - Implemented simple linear model with one predictor variable to quantify the difference in MPG means.
   - Used two sample t- test to discover if there is any statistically significant difference in mpg means for two groups.
  
* Developed multivariate regression models to improve the accuracy of the model.
  - Utilized Anova technique to determine the best model
 * Verified the assumptions (linear relation between predictors and response) for the model by plotting the diagnostic statistics tests.
 * Performed post model -fitting analysis (multicollinearity, outliers) for improving explanatory power of the model
